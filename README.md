# Modeling Glycosylation Effects of Potassium Channels

This repository contains data, code, and figures for the paper "Simulation Modeling of Reduced Glycosylation Effects on Potassium Channels of Mouse Cardiomyocytes" (doi: [10.3389/fphys.2022.816651](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.816651/abstract)). 

# Code

The code is written in MATLAB 2020a. 

# Data

This project is based on our previous in-vitro experiemnts. We used parts of the entire datasets about potassium currents and some of action potential data. All resulta and data sources are available in our paper "Reduced hybrid/complex N-glycosylation disrupts cardiac electrical signaling and calcium handling in a model of dilated cardiomyopathy" (doi: [10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.05.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2019.05.001)).
